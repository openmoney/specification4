The original https://github.com/deefactorial/openmoney-api/tree/master/api/swagger/swagger.yaml file (saved locally at https://github.com/openmoney/specification/blob/master/API_specifications/Swagger_v2.0/swagger.yaml) was used as the starting point.

The Mermade Swagger 2.0 to OpenAPI 3.0.0 converter (https://openapi-converter.herokuapp.com/) was then used to generate the OpenAPI 3.0.0 version from this (here named openapi.yaml).
